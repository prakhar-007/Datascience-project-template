# Cookiecutter Data Science


A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work.


## Documentation

[Reference](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)


## Installation

Requirements

* Python 2.7 or 3.5
* cookiecutter Python package >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

```bash
  pip install cookiecutter
```
    
## Starting a new project

Starting a new project is as easy as running this command at the command line. No need to create a directory first, the cookiecutter will do it for you.
